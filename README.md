# Learning-Driving-Behavior
Designing and training neural network to learn driver behavior
This project designs a multi-layer neural network that reads input images from three front cameras and learns steering behavior of the driver and then drives the car in a different environment than the trainging enviroment.
The network is designed in Keras environment. Code is in python language in the notebook file.
The trained model architecture and learned weights are stored in model_verx_xx.json and model_verx_xx.h5 files.
